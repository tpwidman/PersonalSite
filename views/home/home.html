				   <p>    After a long needed break, I'm happy to say that I'm back into some cool projects.
                   The job search is still going great, but really what I've been wanting to do is 
                   get back into coding with learning Ruby and Node.js. I'll use this blog to keep everyone
                   updated on what I'm doing. I think this week I'll try to finish up my Amazon Echo skill
                   and start learning about this Raspberry Pi that I got for Christmas this year. David, Danny,
                   and I have been working on a Catan variant scenario which is really exciting.</p>
                   <p>    So, expect another post by the end of the week on those things. I've been thinking of making
                   videos about programming and home projects, but I only want to do that if there is enough
                   interest. If you have an idea for a project or if you want me to make you a
                   website, I'd love to help. Either contact me via email or post your ideas in the comments below.

                   Also, my good friend Walter notified me earlier today that the next ITAC Javascript meetup
                   is scheduled for February 11th.
